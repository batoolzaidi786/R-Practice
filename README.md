Class1b A basic R script file to understand manipulating files, data types, data wrangling and cleaning for better statistical analysis
Class1c R syntax basics continued: if function, if else, for loop etc
Class 2.................................
In next task (Class3a) we learnt how to retrieve specific Microarray Data from different public repositories like NCBI's GEO and EMBL's ArrayExpress Biostudies... Particularly we used Microarray data produced through Affymetrix platforms 
In Class 3b, we brought the raw .CEL files from the repositories in the R studio using BioConductor packages, as well as performed their RMA normalization, QC, and pre-processing and filtering 
Class 3c Tasks:
Map probe IDs to gene symbols using AnnotationDbi
  i.  Find the appropriate annotation package for your platform and use it 
  ii. Check how many probes map to the same gene and handle duplicates

Perform differential gene expression analysis using the Limma package

Create a volcano plot showing upregulated and downregulated genes
Generate a heatmap of the top 25 DEGs
Save DEG results (complete, upregulated, downregulated) as CSV files
Export both plots as PNG images in the Results folder
